This project focuses on applying machine learning techniques to the Ames Housing dataset to predict house prices. The main objective is to understand how different models behave with real-world data and how evaluation metrics guide model selection.

Key Steps

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handled missing values, removed outliers, and standardized features for better model performance.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified key variables affecting housing prices such as lot area, overall quality, and living area.

Model Building: Implemented and compared two models — Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor.

Evaluation: Used metrics like  Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to measure accuracy and performance.

Learning Outcomes

The core purpose of this project was to strengthen my understanding of how to choose the right model based on performance metrics. Linear Regression was used as the baseline model to understand linear relationships, while Random Forest was applied to capture non-linear patterns and improve accuracy.

This exercise also helped me practice data handling, feature engineering, and model evaluation, which are essential steps in any machine learning workflow. It demonstrates the importance of iterative experimentation — learning when to switch to more robust models when the simpler ones underperform.
